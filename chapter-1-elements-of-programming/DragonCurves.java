 *  1.2.35 Dragon curves. Write a program to print the instructions for drawing
 *  the dragon curves of order 0 through 5. The instructions are strings of F,
 *  L, and R characters, where F means “draw line while moving 1 unit
 *  forward,” L means “turn left,” and R means “turn right.” A dragon curve of
 *  order n is formed when you fold a strip of paper in half n times, then
 *  unfold to right angles. The key to solving this problem is to note that a
 *  curve of order n is a curve of order n-1 followed by an L followed by a
 *  curve of order n-1 traversed in reverse order, and then to figure out a
 *  similar description for the reverse curve.
